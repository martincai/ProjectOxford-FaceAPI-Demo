# Project Oxford - Face API - Demo
This is a simple demo application for Project Oxford's Face API. It was built based on the [C# SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/ProjectOxford-ClientSDK/tree/master/Face/Windows).  
  
I used it for the first time at the China National Computer Congress 2015 demo booth. Here is a screenshot of the application as shown on CCTV's news report. My code change was very ugly since I had to do it in a very short time. Sorry about that. =)

To access the solution in Visual Studio, go to /Samples and open **FaceApiSamples.sln**. I strongly recommend that you look at the official Project Oxford web site https://www.projectoxford.ai/ or https://cn.projectoxford.ai/ if you are located in China.
